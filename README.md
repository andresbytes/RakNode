# RakNode

### About

RakNode is a basic [RakNet](https://github.com/facebookarchive/RakNet) implementation written in JavaScript.

### Not ready!

This project is still under heavy development. Do not use unless you know what you are doing.

### Inspiration

RakNode is mostly based on the open source library [RakLib](https://github.com/pmmp/RakLib) by [PMMP](https://github.com/pmmp) [PocketNode's RakNet](https://github.com/PocketNode/RakNet).
